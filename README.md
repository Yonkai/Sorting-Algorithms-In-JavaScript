## Use
The controls menu can be found on the left side of the viewport.

1. Set sorting algorithm, currently choices are bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
2. Set animation speed in milliseconds.
3. Set number of elements to sort, represented as spikes on a color wheel.
4. Set color range on the color wheel.
5. Generate visual demonstration, represented as a color wheel.
