# Sorting Algorithms
The purpose of this website is to demonstrate visually how certain sorting algorithm's work and to allow control over specific parameters, and as to function as a personal learning project on Big-O notation and efficiency. 

## Built With
* [HTML5boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Slideout.js](https://github.com/mango/slideout)
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Use
The controls menu can be found on the left side of the viewport.

1. Set sorting algorithm, currently choices are bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
2. Set animation speed in milliseconds.
3. Set number of elements to sort, represented as spikes on a color wheel.
4. Set color range on the color wheel.
5. Generate visual demonstration, represented as a color wheel.

Steps 2 and 4 are activated immediately, steps 1 and 4 occur upon generating a new wheel.
